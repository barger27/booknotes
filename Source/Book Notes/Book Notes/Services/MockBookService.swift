                        SwiftUI is radically different from UIKit. So in this short book, we will
                        help you build a mental model of how SwiftUI works. We explain the most
                        important concepts in detail, and we follow them up with exercises to give
                        you hands-on experience.SwiftUI is still a young framework, and as such, we
                        don't believe it's appropriate to write a complete reference. Instead, this
                        book focuses on transitioning your way of thinking from the object-oriented
                        style of UIKit to the declarative style of SwiftUI.Thinking in SwiftUI is
                        geared toward readers who are familiar with Swift and who have experience
                        building apps in frameworks like UIKit.

                          SwiftUI provides an innovative and simple way to build beautiful user
                          interfaces (UIs) for all Apple platforms, from iOS and macOS through to
                          watchOS and tvOS, using the Swift programming language. In this
                          recipe-based cookbook, you'll cover the foundations of SwiftUI as well as
                          the new SwiftUI 3 features introduced in iOS 15 and explore a range of
                          essential techniques and concepts that will help you through the
                          development process. The cookbook begins by explaining how to use basic
                          SwiftUI components. Once you've learned the core concepts of UI
                          development, such as Views, Controls, Lists, and ScrollViews, using
                          practical implementations in Swift, you'll advance to adding useful
                          features to SwiftUI using drawings, built-in shapes, animations, and
                          transitions. You'll understand how to integrate SwiftUI with exciting new
                          components in the Apple development ecosystem, such as Combine for
                          managing events and Core Data for managing app data. Finally, you'll write
                          iOS, macOS, and watchOS apps by sharing the same SwiftUI codebase. By the
                          end of this SwiftUI book, you'll have discovered a range of simple, direct
                          solutions to common problems encountered when building SwiftUI apps. What
                          You Will Learn: Explore various layout presentations in SwiftUI such as
                          HStack, VStack, LazyHStack, and LazyVGrid Create widgets to quickly
                          display relevant content at glance Get up to speed with drawings in

                          animation and transition techniques in SwiftUI Add user authentication
                          using Firebase and Sign in with Apple Manage concurrency with Combine and
                          async/await in SwiftUI Solve the most common SwiftUI problems, such as
                          integrating a MapKit map, unit testing, snapshot testing, and previewing
                          layouts Who this book is for: This book is for mobile developers who want
                          to learn SwiftUI as well as experienced iOS developers transitioning from
                          UIkit to SwiftUI. The book assumes knowledge of the Swift programming
                          language. Knowledge of object-oriented design and data structures will be
                          useful but not necessary. You'll also find this book to be a helpful
                          resource if you're looking for reference material regarding the
